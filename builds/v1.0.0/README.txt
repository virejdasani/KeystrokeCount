Keystroke Count keeps all your keystroke data locally stored and NO data including your keystrokes is ever collected.

How does Keystroke Count work?
- Keystroke Count lives in your Menu Bar once the app is launched
- The app doesn't show up in the dock or anywhere else
- You can launch Keystroke Count using either the shortcut keys: Alt + Shift + K or by pressing its icon in the menu bar
- You can safely close the app by pressing Escape or clicking anywhere outside the app
- You can quit the app by pressing Command + Q
